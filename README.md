***sbt-jdeps*** is an sbt plugin to run [JDeps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jdeps.html).

## Usage

Add the following settings to your `project/plugins.sbt`:

``` sbt
addSbtPlugin("com.thoughtworks.sbt-jdeps" % "sbt-jdeps" % "latest.release")

After running the `jdeps` task, you can find DOT files generated by `jdeps` at `target/scala-2.12/jdeps`.
